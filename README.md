# DiceRoller
A simple Dice Roller application created using React. The app has been deployed and is live [here](https://diceroller.dhruvjain.co)

## Current Features
- Random dice rolling.
- A decent UI for desktop browsers.

> **Note**: **React** has not been explicitly installed. **React babel** is used in the project for simplification.

## Contributions
This project is open for contributions to enhance and develop the application further. Feel free to create a pull request if you wish to contribute.
